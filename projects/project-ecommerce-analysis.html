    <h2>🛒 E-commerce Sales Insights & Customer Behavior Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior using a real e-commerce dataset.
      Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), I uncovered insights around revenue drivers,
      product category performance, age-based customer behavior, payment preferences,
      and satisfaction ratings.

    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      The main goal of this project was to explore buying patterns and customer behavior in an 
      e-commerce environment. Instead of building a predictive model, this project focuses on 
      business insights and actionable analytics by exploring trends across product categories, cities,
      age groups, payment methods, and ratings.

  <!-- Findings -->
  <section>
    <h3>Key Findings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Electronics generated the most revenue</strong> but received the 
        <strong>lowest average rating (~2.4 stars)</strong>, indicating a quality or expectation gap.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Toys had the highest satisfaction (~3.8 stars)</strong> despite having lower sales,
        likely due to simpler functionality and lower customer expectations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Netbanking was the most commonly used payment method,</strong> followed closely by Cash on Delivery, UPI, 
        and lastly, Credit Card — showing strong digital payment adoption. However, when making bigger purchases, customers still tend to use Credit cards, showing over $200k in revenue, despite the rise of online transactions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Customers aged <strong>46-60</strong> made the most purchases, signaling a strong GenX buyer base.
      </li>
      <li>
        City-level analysis showed clear differences in revenue contributions across locations, with Kolkata making the most in revenue of over $190k.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ratings were centered around <strong>3 stars</strong>, suggesting many “neutral” or moderately satisfied customers.
      </li>
    </ul>
