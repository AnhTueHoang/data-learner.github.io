    <h2>📉 Customer Churn Prediction Using Telco Data</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, I built a classification model to predict which customers are at risk of leaving
      a telecom service (churn). The goal is to help the business identify at-risk customers early,
      so retention campaigns can be targeted more effectively.

  <!-- Overview -->
  <section>
    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      The dataset contains information about telecom customers, including their demographics, and the services 
      they subscribe to, contract type, billing information, and whether they have churned. 
      I approached this as a supervised classification problem, where the target variable is
      <code>Churn</code> (Yes/No).
    </p>
    <p>
      My main goals were to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand what types of customers are more likely to churn.</li>
      <li>Build a predictive model that flags at-risk customers.</li>
      <li>Translate model results into simple, business-friendly insights.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Dataset -->
  <section>
    <h3>Dataset & Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rows:</strong> ~7,000 customers</li>
      <li><strong>Target:</strong> <code>Churn</code> (Yes / No)</li>
      <li><strong>Key features include:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><code>gender</code>, <code>SeniorCitizen</code>, <code>Partner</code>, <code>Dependents</code></li>
          <li><code>tenure</code> – months with the company</li>
          <li><code>PhoneService</code>, <code>InternetService</code>, <code>StreamingTV</code>, etc.</li>
          <li><code>Contract</code> – Month-to-month, One year, Two year</li>
          <li><code>PaperlessBilling</code>, <code>PaymentMethod</code></li>
          <li><code>MonthlyCharges</code>, <code>TotalCharges</code></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Converted <code>TotalCharges</code> to numeric and filled missing values with the median to handle
        data type inconsistencies.
      </li>
      <li>Removed <code>customerID</code> since it’s an identifier and not useful for prediction.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Process -->
  <section>
    <h3>Process & Approach</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Loaded the Telco Customer Churn dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.</li>
      <li>Cleaned the data by fixing the <code>TotalCharges</code> column and handling missing values.</li>
      <li>Explored churn patterns using visualizations (e.g., churn distribution, tenure vs churn, 
          contract type vs churn, monthly charges vs churn).</li>
      <li>Separated the target variable <code>Churn</code> and encoded it as 0 (No) and 1 (Yes).</li>
      <li>Split the dataset into training and test sets using an 80/20 split.</li>
      <li>
        Built a preprocessing pipeline using <code>ColumnTransformer</code> to:
        <ul>
          <li>Standardize numeric features: <code>tenure</code>, <code>MonthlyCharges</code>, <code>TotalCharges</code>.</li>
          <li>One-hot encode categorical features (contract type, internet service, payment method, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Combined preprocessing with a <strong>Logistic Regression</strong> model in a single
        scikit-learn <code>Pipeline</code>, ensuring consistent transformations for train and test data.
      </li>
      <li>Trained the model and evaluated it using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and a confusion matrix.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
  <h3>Key Analytical Findings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Class imbalance:</strong> About one-quarter of customers churned while the majority stayed. 
      This makes churn a minority class, highlighting the challenge of accurately predicting it.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Tenure:</strong> Customers who churn typically have significantly shorter tenure. Many leave 
      within their first 10 months, while customers who stay tend to have much longer relationships with 
      the company.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Contract type:</strong> Month-to-month contracts show the highest churn rates, while one-year 
      and two-year contracts are associated with much lower churn, indicating that contract commitment 
      strongly reduces churn risk.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Monthly charges:</strong> Customers who churn tend to pay higher monthly charges. This suggests 
      that expensive plans may feel less valuable or carry more financial risk, making customers more likely 
      to leave.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h3>Model Performance & Interpretation</h3>
  <p>
    I trained a Logistic Regression model using the preprocessed features and evaluated it on an 80/20 train-test split.
    The model reached an overall <strong>accuracy of 82%</strong>. 
    Because churn prediction is imbalanced, accuracy alone is not enough — so I evaluated precision, recall, and F1 score 
    for the churn class specifically.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Precision (churn = 1): 0.69</strong> — When the model predicts a customer will churn, it is correct 69% of the time.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Recall (churn = 1): 0.60</strong> — The model correctly identifies 60% of customers who actually churn.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>F1 Score (churn = 1): 0.64</strong> — This reflects a balanced performance between precision and recall.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Precision (non-churn = 0): 0.86</strong> and 
      <strong>Recall (non-churn = 0): 0.90</strong> — The model is very strong at identifying customers who stay.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These results are typical for churn prediction problems, where the minority class (churners) is harder to identify.
    The confusion matrix shows that the model correctly predicted most non-churners (934 true negatives) and several churners 
    (223 true positives), but it still missed some churners (150 false negatives).
  </p>

  <p>
    This indicates that although the model is a solid starting point, future improvements could focus on boosting recall for 
    the churn class through class weighting, oversampling techniques, or trying more advanced algorithms like Random Forest 
    or XGBoost.
