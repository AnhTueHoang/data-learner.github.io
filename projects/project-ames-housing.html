    <h2>🏡 Predicting House Prices Using Ames Housing Data</h2>
    <p>
      This project explores how different types of square footage influence house sale prices.
      I worked on this project in my free time as part of my journey into the data world, and 
      it represents my first complete end-to-end machine learning workflow—from loading real data
      all the way to training, evaluating, and interpreting a model.

  <!-- Project Overview -->
  <section>
    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      The goal of this project was to build a simple, interpretable model that can predict house prices 
      using a subset of variables from the Ames Housing dataset. Instead of using every possible feature, 
      I focused on a small group of meaningful square footage features to keep the project clear and 
      beginner-friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project helped me practice working with real data, understand the modeling process, and 
      start building confidence in my ability to ask questions and find answers using data.

    <h3>Dataset</h3>

          AmesHousing_simple.csv
        </a>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Target variable:</strong> <code>SalePrice</code> (house sale price)</li>
      <li><strong>Selected features:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><code>BsmtFin SF 1</code> – finished basement square footage</li>
          <li><code>Bsmt Unf SF</code> – unfinished basement square footage</li>
          <li><code>Total Bsmt SF</code> – total basement area</li>
          <li><code>1st Flr SF</code> – first floor square footage</li>
          <li><code>2nd Flr SF</code> – second floor square footage</li>
          <li><code>Gr Liv Area</code> – above-ground living area</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Process -->
  <section>
    <h3>Process & Approach</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Loaded the dataset into a Google Colab notebook using <code>pandas.read_csv()</code>.</li>
      <li>Explored the data with <code>df.head()</code>, <code>df.info()</code>, and <code>df.describe()</code>.</li>
      <li>Checked for missing values and confirmed the data was mostly clean.</li>
      <li>Visualized relationships between square footage and price using histograms and scatterplots.</li>
      <li>Selected a small set of interpretable features focused on different types of space in the home.</li>
      <li>Split the data into training and test sets using <code>train_test_split</code>.</li>
      <li>Trained a linear regression model to predict <code>SalePrice</code>.</li>
      <li>Evaluated the model using Mean Squared Error and a predicted vs actual price scatter plot.</li>
      <li>Interpreted the model coefficients to understand which features mattered most.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Key Findings -->
  <section>
    <h3>Key Findings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Above-ground living space (1st and 2nd floor)</strong> had the strongest impact on price.
        The coefficients suggested that each additional square foot on these floors added over \$120 
        to the predicted sale price.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Basement space</strong> also increased house value, but less than the main living areas. 
        Finished basement space was more valuable than unfinished space.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Multicollinearity</strong> appeared between <code>Gr Liv Area</code> and the individual 
        floor features. Because they contain overlapping information, one of the coefficients appeared 
        negative even though more living area clearly increases price. This taught me an important lesson 
        about being careful when including highly correlated features in the same model.
      </li>
      <li>
        Even a simple linear model can provide useful insights about which features matter most, as long as 
        you choose interpretable variables and think carefully about the results.
      </li>
    </ul>
