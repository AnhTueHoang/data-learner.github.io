    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is <strong>Jenny Hoang</strong>. I graduated from DePaul University 
      with a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems, and I've always had a natural curiosity 
      for how things work, why things happen, and what data can reveal behind everyday decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm currently working as a <strong>Project Coordinator at Amsive</strong>. Outside of work, 
      I spend my free time learning tools, practicing analysis techniques, and building data 
      projects—just like the ones featured on this site. My goal is to transition into the 
      <strong>data field</strong> because I genuinely enjoy exploring datasets, solving problems, 
      and uncovering meaningful stories hidden in numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hope to pursue a <strong>master’s degree in a data-related field</strong> in the future. 
      Career-wise, I’m working step by step toward creating a meaningful path in analytics and 
      technology. Personally, I dream of buying a big home one day, traveling the world with my 
      family, and living a life full of curiosity and adventure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of data, I love <strong>traveling</strong>, discovering new places, and yes—doing 
      some <strong>shopping</strong> like many girls do. Life should be both productive and fun.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you so much for stopping by and viewing my work. I hope you enjoy the stories 
      behind the datasets I explore, and I hope my journey inspires you in your own path too.
    </p>
