      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is <strong>Jenny Hoang</strong>. I graduated from DePaul University with a 
        Bachelor of Science in Information Systems, and I’ve always been naturally curious about 
        how things work, why things happen, and what data can reveal about everyday life.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m currently working as a <strong>Project Coordinator at Amsive</strong>. In my free time, 
        I dive into the data world by building projects like the ones on this site. I enjoy solving 
        problems, exploring datasets, and turning raw numbers into insights that make sense.
      </p>

      <p>
        My goal is to <strong>shift my career into the data field</strong> because I genuinely enjoy 
        doing this kind of work—experimenting with tools, learning new techniques, and discovering 
        stories behind the data. I’m also interested in pursuing a <strong>master’s degree in a 
        data-related field</strong> in the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        Personally, I dream of buying a big home one day and traveling around the world with my 
        family. I love <strong>traveling</strong> and, like many girls, I enjoy <strong>shopping</strong> 
        and finding little things that make life more fun.
      </p>

      <p>
        Things might change over time, but for now I’m taking small, consistent steps toward 
        that bigger picture. I really appreciate anyone who stops by to view my work. I hope you 
        enjoy the stories I discover behind my datasets.
      </p>
